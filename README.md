# dashboard_material

Here is the repository of the course about building an interactive dashboard using Python.

It will be used to store the code material/ exercise involved in this course.

It it great to practice the coding skill and data handling skill with the flow of how data science work.

All the materials was used to be a reference for my routine work/ future work as well.

All the python files was used to clean the mindset of dealing with the time series data.

All the function was defined to handle same type/ kinds of data and encapsulated into classes later.

Data is special for the related COVID-19 data set and adjustment is needed for other set of data.

After that, HTML & CSS was used to build the dashboard and deploy for production.
